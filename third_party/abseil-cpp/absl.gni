# This file contains the definition of the template absl_source_set which
# should be the only type of target needed in abseil's BUILD.gn files.
# This template will correctly set "configs" and "public_configs" in order
# to correctly compile abseil in Chromium.
#
# Usage:
# Most of the times its usage will be similar to the example below but all
# the arguments avilable in source_set are also available for absl_source_set.

#    sources = [ "foo.cc" ]
